Wireframing: Key Elements and Their Role in Design
Wireframing is the process of creating a visual blueprint of a user interface before the actual design and development begin. It focuses on structure and functionality, not colors or branding. A wireframe helps product teams, developers, and stakeholders visualize how users will interact with the system.

Below are the key elements commonly found in wireframes, along with explanations and examples of how they shape the overall design:

## 1. üß≠ Layout Structure
What it is:
The skeletal framework of the page that shows how the screen is divided into sections.

Why it's important:
It ensures consistent visual hierarchy, prioritizing content and guiding the user's attention.

Example:
In a hotel booking app, the layout might include:

A top bar with logo and search bar

A middle section displaying hotel cards

A sidebar for filters (price, location, rating)

A footer with contact info

‚û°Ô∏è This structure helps users quickly navigate and understand the content without getting overwhelmed.

## 2. üîó Navigation
What it is:
Menus, tabs, and links that guide users through different parts of the system.

Why it's important:
Good navigation ensures smooth user flow and accessibility to core features.

Example:
A navigation bar might include:

Home

Browse Hotels

My Bookings

Help

Login/Logout

‚û°Ô∏è Easy-to-access navigation lets users move between pages like search, booking, and profile without confusion.

## 3. üìù Content Placement
What it is:
Defines where elements like text, buttons, images, and forms will be positioned.

Why it's important:
Proper content placement improves readability, focus, and conversion rates.

Example:
On the booking confirmation page:

Title at the top ("Booking Confirmed!")

Booking details in the center

"Print" and "Back to Home" buttons at the bottom

‚û°Ô∏è This layout makes it easy for users to read important info and take further action.

## 4. ‚öôÔ∏è Functionality
What it is:
Interactive components such as search bars, forms, buttons, dropdowns, and filters.

Why it's important:
Even in a low-fidelity wireframe, showing functionality helps visualize user interactions.

Example:
In the hotel search screen:

A filter dropdown for price range

A search bar with a calendar date picker

A ‚ÄúBook Now‚Äù button on each hotel card
